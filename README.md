simple stupid program, that asks the date, the month and the year of birth, and gives a 'spank' for each year of life. 
yeah, i know, it is the most nitwit program you may have ever seen, but i am determined to make it better, for example by recognizing 
the bissextile years: if the given month is february, but the given day is more than '29', it will give an error message and 
ask again for the day. theese are the kinds of improovement that i' m trying to give to the program, to finally solve this exercice 
and go further to the next step in learning ruby language: the objects!

thanks for everyone that will give a hand
